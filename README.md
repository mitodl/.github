# About Us
The mission of Open Learning is to transform teaching and learning at MIT and around the
globe through the innovative use of digital technologies. As the engineering group, our
role is the “digital technologies” part of the mission statement. We build and run the
platforms that Open Learning relies on to provide educational opportunities within MIT
and to learners worldwide.

# How We Work
We are an agile team without being dogmatic about it. We believe that every engineer
should take ownership and pride in their work. You can read more in our public
